# Multiple Blink
- David Sheppard
- Created 16 September 2018
- Adapted from code found on TI resource explorer.
## Purpose
Blinks 2 LEDs on the board at different rates. This is done using an infinite while loop. The blinking is synchornous (LED's time on = time off). The fast LED blinks at a rate twice as fast as the slower one. The --delay_cycles() function is used to create delay between the blinks.
