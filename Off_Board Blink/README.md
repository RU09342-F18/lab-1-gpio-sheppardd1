# Off-Board Blink
## Purpose
The microprocessor is programmed and then removed from the board and placed onto a breadboard. The micropocessor causes 2 LEDs to blink at different rates.
## Board layout (as seen in picture below)
- P1.0: Red LED
- P1.5: Green LED
- 3.3 V is supplied by the development board
- Reset circuitry consists of a switch, a 1 nF capacitor, and a 47 kOhm resistor
## Demo
The demo below shows the circuit running and the reset switch being pressed twice. The file an be found in video format at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gjwNIF5b_0l1aHeVIs4melQUvIx8G14g/view?usp=sharing
